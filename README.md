## My process

### Built with

- CSS custom variables
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

learned how to use and input variables. 



```
/* Variables */

:root {
  --white: hsl(0, 0%, 100%);
  --stone-100: hsl(30, 54%, 90%);
  --stone-150: hsl(30, 18%, 87%);
  --stone-600: hsl(30, 10%, 34%);
  --stone-900: hsl(24, 5%, 18%);
  --brown-800: hsl(14, 45%, 36%);
  --rose-800: hsl(332, 51%, 32%);
  --rose-50: hsl(330, 100%, 98%);
  }
```

### Continued development

I am still warming up to coding and using CSS. So i will continue to get my feet wet with little projects like this.
